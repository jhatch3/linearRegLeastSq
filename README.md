# Linear Regression using Least Squares
- Used File i/o in python to read 100 (x,y) points from a data.txt file, and matplot to plot the 100 points.
- Used Least Squares method to generate a best fit line based on the 100 points. 
- Plotted the best fit line against the 100 points and calculated the error.


# TODO: 
- Clean Up code
- Refactor
- Comments (docstrings)
- Remove hard codded xlim/ylim and line length
- Write rough draft report
